```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(reticulate)
use_virtualenv("r-reticulate")
py_available(TRUE)
```

## The below code is an example of how Phython works in R Markdown.

I would Recommended looking into the package `reticulate`. It has some nice properties which allow the use of phython in your R Markdown file.
Connecting to SQL is similar, just change {python} for {sql} (you will need to set up your SQL connection in a prior chunk to connect to the database)

```{python}
x = 'hello, python world!'
print(x.split(' '))
```
